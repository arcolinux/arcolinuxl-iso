# Often package installation needs an internet connection.
# Since you may allow system installation without a connection
# and want to offer **optional** package installation, it's
# possible to have no internet, yet have this packages module
# enabled in settings.
#
# You can skip the whole module when there is no internet
# by setting *skip_if_no_internet* to true.
#
# You can run a package-manager specific update procedure
# before installing packages (for instance, to update the
# list of packages and dependencies); this is done only if there
# is an internet connection. Set *update_db* to true to do so.
skip_if_no_internet: false

#
# List of maps with package operations such as install or remove.
# Distro developers can provide a list of packages to remove
# from the installed system (for instance packages meant only
# for the live system).
#
# A job implementing a distro specific logic to determine other
# packages that need to be installed or removed can run before
# this one. Distro developers may want to install locale packages
# or remove drivers not needed on the installed system.
# Such a job would populate a list of dictionaries in the global
# storage called "packageOperations" and that list is processed
# after the static list in the job configuration (i.e. the list
# that is in this configuration file).
#
#operations:
#  - install:
#      - pkg1
#      - pkg2
#  - remove:
#      - pkg3
#      - pkg4
#  - try_install:   # no system install failure if a package cannot be installed
#      - pkg5
#  - try_remove:    # no system install failure if a package cannot be removed
